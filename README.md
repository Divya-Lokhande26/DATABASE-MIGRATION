 *** INSTRUCTIONS *** 
 
1) MIGRATE DATA BETWEEN TWO
   DATABASES (E.G., FROM MYSQL TO
   POSTGRESQL) AND ENSURE DATA
   INTEGRITY
   
2) DELIVERABLE: MIGRATION SCRIPTS AND
   A SUMMARY REPORT OF THE PROCESS.

  *** Deliverable: Migration Scripts and a Summary Report of the Process ***

   1. Migration Scripts

     The migration scripts will include SQL and procedural scripts required for transferring data from MySQL to PostgreSQL while ensuring data integrity. These scripts will cover:

1) Schema Conversion: Scripts for converting MySQL schema (tables, constraints, indexes, etc.) to PostgreSQL-compatible schema.
   
2) Data Extraction and Transformation: SQL/ETL scripts for extracting data from MySQL, transforming it if necessary (data type conversions, normalization), and preparing it for PostgreSQL.

3) Data Loading: Bulk insert scripts or COPY commands to efficiently load data into PostgreSQL.

4) Validation Queries: SQL queries to compare data counts, checksums, or specific field values between MySQL and PostgreSQL to verify data consistency.

5) Error Handling & Logging: Scripts to log errors or inconsistencies encountered during migration.


2. Summary Report of the Process
   
   The summary report will document the migration process, challenges faced, and verification steps.
   It will include:

1) Overview of Migration: A high-level description of the migration, including database versions, tools used (e.g., pgloader, custom scripts), and the migration approach.

2) Schema Conversion Details: Explanation of schema differences, modifications, and compatibility adjustments made for PostgreSQL.

3) Data Migration Steps: Step-by-step execution process, including extraction, transformation, and loading techniques.

4) Data Integrity Verification: Methods used to verify that migrated data remains accurate and complete, including row counts, checksums, and sample data comparisons.

5) Challenges & Solutions: Common issues encountered (e.g., data type mismatches, indexing differences) and the solutions implemented.

   
>>> Final Validation & Conclusion: Summary of validation results and confirmation of a successful migration.
